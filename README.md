# SegmentationForVortexIdentification

The study of fluid dynamics plays a pivotal role in advancing numerous applied sciences, yet the accurate identification and segmentation of vortical structures within turbulent flows remains a challenge. Traditional methods, while useful, often fall short in terms of precision, adaptability, and efficiency.

This dissertation explores a ground-breaking approach using transformers, a technology renowned in the field of natural language processing, adapted to analyse turbulent fluid dynamics through advanced image segmentation techniques. In this research, I have developed a transformer-based model that leverages the unique capabilities of transformers—particularly their proficiency in managing long-range data dependencies—to handle the spatial correlations inherent in turbulent flow fields.

This study compares the performance of this novel transformer model against traditional computer vision techniques and contemporary convolutional neural network (CNN) models to determine if it offers improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness when analysing dynamic flow variations.

The findings from this study have shown that the application of transformers for vortex identification is both feasible and promising. The results demonstrated a segmentation accuracy of mIoU 62.5% and precision of 88%. Although this was less than the U-Net model in comparison, the findings have enhanced the field of fluid dynamics by introducing a precise, efficient, and reliable methodology for vortex detection and analysis. This approach potentially sets a new standard for future research in applying machine learning to tackle complex challenges in fluid dynamics.
